October 2023:

Added the Library page to the dashboard utilizing an array to store book objects from the user inputs. The user can
add a new book via a form by using the Add Book button - use of modal. When a book has been read, the left of the card display turns green, and the unread remains yellow. Existing read/unread books can be edited or deleted.


September 2023:

The full dashboard design utilizes Grid. This attempts to resemble The Odin Project design file
for the Intermediate HTML and CSS Course.

The icons were downloaded from Material Design Icons at https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/.
